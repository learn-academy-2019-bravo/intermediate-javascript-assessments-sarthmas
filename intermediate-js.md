# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

They do different things: .filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while .map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Itâ€™s a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and datasets into their own variable. It allows us to extract properties from an object or items from an array, multiple at a time.  You would use it to simplify your code later on by creating a new variable that more clearly identifies the information you are referencing.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

A var variable can be redeclared and updated.
A let variable be be updated but not redeclared.
A const can never be changed.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important:
- so you can confirm that code acts as intended,
- to test the user experience,
- to test for edge cases,
- to test for unanticipated side effects,
- to test for functionality as you go, rather than waiting until you have finished a huge project
- to identify bugs or problems in your code
- to reassure customers or managers that the code is working before it is deployed

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function takes in a function as an argument.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

A class is a template for objects.  An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

It is fun to learn about how other people perceive challenges and think through problems. It helps to expand your own understanding to think about problems and solutions from a variety of viewpoints and perspectives.  

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

There are three possible ways to link a CSS file to your HTML page:
- Inline Style
- Embedded Style
- External Style

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

A class is used to consistently style multiple elements throughout the page/site. Classes are useful when you have, or possibly will have in the future, more than one element that shares the same style. An example may be a div of "comments" or a certain list style to use for related links.

A given element can have more than one class associated with it, while an element can only have one id. For example, you can give a div two classes whose styles will both take effect.

The ID is used for a single element on the page that will take the style. IDs must be unique.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

<h1>	First-level headline
<h2>	Second-level headline
<h3>	Third-level headline
<h4>	Fourth-level headline

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

Boostrap, Flexible Images, Media Queries

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
